## Scope
To use a Pandas and Jupyter Notebook for analysis of city school data that includes spending and test scores. The goal is to organize the data in multiple groupings to determine trends in test scores in relation to school budget.

## General Methods
`PyCitySchools_starter-checkpoint.ipynb` priamrily utilizes the `pandas` library and standard python commands such as `groupby` to create multiple dataframes. these datframes were grouped in various methods, including by school, by district, by school size, by per capita spending, and by school type.
The individual student test scores in math and reading were averaged to be able to compare against overall school spending.
